# SleeperCommishIntegrityChecker
Verify your Fantasy Football Commissioner with this Python script! Utilizing the Sleeper API, this script queries the number of leagues that a commissioner is involved in and the number of leagues they are commissioning. Ensure that your commissioner is trustworthy by easily checking their level of involvement in the Fantasy Football community.

Sleeper API Documentation: https://docs.sleeper.com/#introduction

You'll need the league ID for your league. This can be found in the URL of your Sleeper league: https://sleeper.com/leagues/<this_number_right_here>/matchup. Or if you open the App and go to your league -> League tab -> Settings (the gear icon) -> General, and then scroll to the bottom.
